#Go OpenCV binding

## Why fork?
Original project (https://code.google.com/p/go-opencv) looks abandoned. Therefore, I decide to fork it and host it on Github, so that others can help to maintain this package.

## TODOs
- More details doc
- Implement more bindings

## Install

### Linux
- install Go1 and OpenCV
- `go get github.com/lazywei/go-opencv`

- install OpenCV-2.4.x to MinGW dir
  - libopencv*.dll --> ${MinGWRoot}\bin
