Go OpenCV binding
==================

A Golang binding for [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/).

[**DISCLAIMER**](https://github.com/lazywei/go-opencv#disclaimer)

## Install

### Linux & Mac OS X

Install Go and OpenCV, you might want to install both of them via `apt-get` or `homebrew`.

```
go get github.com/lazywei/go-opencv
cd ${GoOpenCVRoot}/samples && go run hellocv.go
```

### Windows

- Install Go and MinGw
- install OpenCV-2.4.x to MinGW dir

```
# libopencv*.dll --> ${MinGWRoot}\bin
# libopencv*.lib --> ${MinGWRoot}\lib
# include\opencv --> ${MinGWRoot}\include\opencv
# include\opencv2 --> ${MinGWRoot}\include\opencv2

go get code.google.com/p/go-opencv/trunk/opencv
cd ${GoOpenCVRoot}/trunk/samples && go run hellocv.go
```

## TODOs

- [ ] Better documents
- [ ] Split the big package into sub-packages corresponding to the modules described in [OpenCV API Reference](http://docs.opencv.org/modules/core/doc/intro.html)
- [ ] Clean up the codes

## Example

### Resizing

```go
package main

import opencv "github.com/lazywei/go-opencv/opencv"

func main() {
	filename := "bert.jpg"
	srcImg := opencv.LoadImage(filename)
	if srcImg == nil {
		panic("Loading Image failed")
	}
	defer srcImg.Release()
	resized1 := opencv.Resize(srcImg, 400, 0, 0)
	resized2 := opencv.Resize(srcImg, 300, 500, 0)
	resized3 := opencv.Resize(srcImg, 300, 500, 2)
	opencv.SaveImage("resized1.jpg", resized1, 0)
	opencv.SaveImage("resized2.jpg", resized2, 0)
	opencv.SaveImage("resized3.jpg", resized3, 0)
}
```

### Webcam

Yet another cool example is created by @saratovsource which demos how to use webcam:

```
cd samples
go run webcam.go
```

  git remote rename origin upstream
  git remote add origin https://github.com/your_github_account/go-opencv.git
  ```

- Create new feature branch

  ```
  git checkout -b your-feature-branch
  ```

- Commit your change and push it to your repo 

  ```
  git commit -m 'new feature'
  git push origin your-feature-branch
  ```

- Open a pull request!

## Disclaimer

This is a fork of [chai's go-opencv](https://github.com/chai2010/opencv). At the time of the fork (Dec 9, 2013) the original project was inactive, and hence I decide to host a fork on Github so people can contribute to this project easily. However, now it seems to be active again starting from Aug 25, 2014. Efforts to merge the two projects are very welcome.
